This repository has files containing passengers' data from the Titanic which includes:
- Passenger Id
- Economic Status (Class)
- Sex
- Age
- Survival
> Raw data can be found in file 'titatic.csv'

You will also find an R file labelled 'titanic.R' and its output in file 'titanic.RData'. Here you will find data such as the number of passengers who survived, the distribution of passenger class (first, second and third), the age distribution of passengers, the relationship between passengers' class, sex, age and their survival as well as the visualization of these results.

Lastly a .png file can also be found in this repository containing the visualization of the predicted probability of survival of male passengers by passenger class and age.
